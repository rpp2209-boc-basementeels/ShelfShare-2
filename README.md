3. **Orders**

A registered user would be notified of any of their books being requested by another user. The notification will provide them with the distribution center (DC) shipping address, keeping in line with anonymity.

Users can also navigate to their profile, and go to the Orders section. The Orders feature will display the books borrowed from other registered users, and the books loaned out to other registered users. They will also be able to see the expected ship to owner date(s) and expected return date(s).

The orders will also display orders that are pending shipment. After the user has dropped off the book to a parcel carrier, they can click the confirmation button to update the order to the loaned list.
